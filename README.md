English Please!
===============

Chrome Extension that forces all Google products to use English by setting `hl=en` in all *.google.com urls.

Clone this repo and load it in chrome extension.
Why?
----

This small extension solves Google language auto-detection problem which causes troubles for people who want their content in English no matter where they are.


For paranoic people
-------------------

When you will be installing this, permission to access `*.google.com` will be asked. It is required only for getting URL and rewriting it with `hl=en` in the query string, which forces English language.
