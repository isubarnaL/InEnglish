English Please!
===============

Chrome Extension that forces all Google products to use English.

Why?
====

This small extension solves Google language auto-detection problem which causes troubles for people who want their content in English no matter where they are.

Here is a [discussion about the particular issue of Google services](http://productforums.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!msg/chrome/NFQGOS4kM3k/8H7twZQLnTkJ).

For paranoic people
===================

When you will be installing this, permission to access `*.google.com` will be asked. It is required only for getting URL and rewriting it with `hl=en` in the query string, which forces English language.
